# ECON2350-Regression-Project---Economics-of-Real-Estate-Pricing

This project is for a course at Northeastern University - ECON 2350 (Statistics for Economics) and focuses on applying regression analysis to the economics of real estate pricing. Using the dataset given to us “ArlHome5.xlsx”, which contains information on home sales including the sale price (Price), square footage (SqFt), number of bedrooms (Beds), and number of bathrooms (Baths), the objective is to understand how these characteristics influence housing values. By treating price as the dependent variable and the other features as independent variables, we can estimate models that quantify the relationship between home attributes and market value.

The assignment/project is structured around building and comparing four regression models: one simple linear regression and three multiple regression models. Each model increases in complexity by adding explanatory variables, allowing us to evaluate how square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms individually and jointly impact housing prices. This stepwise approach highlights the marginal effect of each factor while also teaching key statistical concepts such as coefficient interpretation, model fit (R² and adjusted R²), and hypothesis testing for both individual and joint significance.

The broader goal of this project is twofold: to gain a deep, hands-on understanding of regression as a statistical method, and to apply it meaningfully in an economic context. In real estate markets, pricing is influenced by a variety of measurable features, and regression provides a framework to estimate the expected contribution of each. By the end of the analysis, we aim not only to determine which model best predicts housing prices in Arlington but also to develop the ability to critically interpret regression results and apply them to practical decision-making in economics and real estate.
